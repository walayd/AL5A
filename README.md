# Software Architecture (2018)

## Project Organization

### Project tracking deliverables
Each team creates a github repository, which should contain a `deliverables` directory located at the root. In this directory, two files are mandatory:
- `status.md` a markdown file, updated each Sunday at midnight at the latest. This file should contain a log for each week, showing what was achieved, what is planned for the following week, what are the blockers and risks. Do not drill down in the content details, this is just a status report, but fill it consistently and honestly. In addition, indicate a Red/Yellow/Green flag showing your perception of where you think you are compared to where you think you should be. Each week, you should *add* the status to this file, on top, with the date, but leave previous week statuses below, do not replace, so you can see the full history in the blink of an eye.
- `architecture.pdf` contains the current state of your architecture. The format of this document is up to you, it will grow during the project and should contain a living description of your architecture, with diagrams and explanation texts.
In addition, the content of that folder should be taged with `tag_[weeknumber]` with `[weeknumber]` the two-digit number of the week of the Sunday of the delivery, as can be checked on [this website](https://weeknumber.net/).
